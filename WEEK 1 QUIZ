 1.What does h(3231) return for the following function definition?

   def h(x):
      (m,a) = (1,0)
      while m <= x:
          (m,a) = (m*2,a+1)
      return(a)
  
 ANS:- 12

 2.What is g(24) - g(23), given the definition of g below?

   def g(n):
      s=0
      for i in range(1,n+1):
        if n%i == 0:
           s = s+1
      return(s)
  
 ANS:- 6

3.onsider the following function f.

  def f(n):
    s=0
    for i in range(1,n+1):
        if n%i == 0:
           s = s+1
    return(s%2 == 1)

    The function f(n) given above returns True for a positive number n if and only if:

    a.n is an odd number.
    b.n is a prime number.
    c.n is a composite number.
    d.n is a perfect square.
 ANS:-d.n is a perfect square.

4.Consider the following function f.

  def f(m):
    if m == 0:
      return(0)
    else:
      return(m+f(m-1))

  Which of the following is correct?

  a.The function always terminates with f(n) = factorial of n
  b.The function always terminates with f(n) = n(n+1)/2
  c.The function terminates for non­negative n with f(n) = factorial of n
  d.The function terminates for non­negative n with f(n) = n(n+1)/2
 ANS:-d.The function terminates for non­negative n with f(n) = n(n+1)/2
